    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Before going to the regularization of the Automatic Identification System (AIS) data this document starts with the introduction of the format of the data. Some recommendations on what additional data can be obtained from the \"raw\" AIS data that are not available in our data set are provided. Also some background information on the data is provided. If the reader is familiar with the data they can skip this section and go on reading the script commentary that starts with the subsection _\"Reading the AIS data\"_. The AIS data was collected for the purposes of the BIAS project (https://biasproject.wordpress.com/). The recommendations and comments are most useful for people wanting to use the AIS data for recorded underwater sound analysis.\n",

    "The AIS data for all the sound monitoring locations for the year 2014 was collected and saved in the _.txt_ file format. For every monitoring location exists 12 of the files, one for each month of the year. The first few lines of the _.txt_ file look as following\n",

For example when they change their country of registration.\n",

    "- __L1, L2, B1, B2__ give the location of the AIS transponde onboard the ship by giving in meters\n",
