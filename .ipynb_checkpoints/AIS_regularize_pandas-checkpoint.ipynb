    "\n",
    "Before going to the regularization of the Automatic Identification System (AIS) data this document starts with the introduction of the format of the data. Some recommendations on what additional data can be obtained from the \"raw\" AIS data that are not available in our data set are provided. Also some background information on the data is provided. If the reader is familiar with the data they can skip this section and go on reading the script commentary that starts with the subsection _\"Reading the AIS data\"_. The AIS data was collected for the purposes of the BIAS project (https://biasproject.wordpress.com/). The recommendations and comments are most useful for people wanting to use the AIS data for recorded underwater sound analysis.\n",

For example when they change their country of registration.\n",
    "- __TYPEc__ is the two numbered code for the type of the vessel. It can be decoded to give name of the type of the ship. These categories can be somewhat broad.\n",
    "- __L1, L2, B1, B2__ give the location of the AIS transponde onboard the ship by giving in meters\n",
